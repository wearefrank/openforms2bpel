# Uw-Gegevens Workflow

The most commonly used workflow by far. It is used whenever a form simply needs to result in a new case, based on the formdata.

**Triggered on:** presence of a section with the name starting with `uw-gegevens`.

**Requirements:**
- **uw-gegevens** section
- TODO

### Workflow steps
1. Filter **uw-gegevens** section based on the used authentication method and subject entity(Person with/without DigiD, Organization with/without E-Herkenning).

1. Check if the form contains a completed payment.

   :::info
   Handling of the actual payment is done by OpenForms. The form won't be delivered to the integration until the payment is already fully confirmed completed.
   However, the payment infomation still needs to be added to the case with a completed status, so that the SAP-integration is triggered and has the necessary information.
   :::

1. Retrieve OpenForms form result PDF document and base64 from [Documenten API](.).

1. Update the initiating subject's e-mail and telephone number by calling [UpdateInitiatingSubjectGegMagCommand](.). 

   :::note
   The update needs to happen before the **register** message, as the BPEL-Basic process uses this data to add the initiating subject on the case, if the initiating subject is authenticated.
   :::

1. Create and send **initiate** message to [basic-service](.). This triggers a BPEL backend process to start. It is not clear what this action does exactly.
   
1. Create and send **register** message to [basic-service](.). A new BPEL-Basic process will be started, which includes creating a new case with attached resources and entities.
   The sections in the **register** message are built and composed by several XSLT's conditionally and based on the formdata.
   
   The **register** message contains the following:
   - Generic case information
   - Short info on attachments
   - OpenForms result PDF
   - Translated initiating subject details
   - Additonal translated parties and their role
   - Optional payment details
   - E-mail contact details
   - Transformed formdata
   <br/>
   :::info
   A successful **register** action signals the point-of-no-return. Every action that follows needs to have an exactly-once guarantee. Currently this is achieved by using a **MessageStore** for each action,
   so that they can be retried from the **ErrorStore** in the case of errors.
   :::

1. (payment only) Correct the payment's `reference` with the `order-id` provided by OpenForm on the payment attached to the case, that was created by the BPEL-Basic process during the **register** action.
   Additionally add a new **payment status** to the payment, to indicate that the payment has been processed and is completed. This is done by calling [UpdatePaymentCommand](.).

1. (attachments only) Upload all attachments provided in the form to the **Document vault**, add them to the case and signal that the documents are ready to be processed from the **Document vault**.
   This is done by calling [AddDocumentsToCaseCommand](.).
