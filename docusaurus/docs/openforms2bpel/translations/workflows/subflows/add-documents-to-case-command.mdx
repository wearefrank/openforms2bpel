# Add Documents To Case Command

This workflow facilitates uploading one or more documents and attaching them to a case in a batch.

**input:** Custom datastructure created by `Common/xsl/CreateAddDocumentsToCaseCommand.xslt`. Contains the target case reference and initiating subject identification with the used authentication method translated from a **uw-gegevens** section.
An array of url's to documents in the [documenten-api](.) that need to be uploaded and attached to the case is also included.

### Workflow steps
1. Start a new batch by creating and sending a `documents:startBatch` message to the [document-service](.). A **batchnumber** is returned.
   
   :::info
   A **Provider** section is included representing the subject uploading the documents. The **Provider** is used by backend services to assign permissions on the documents in the DMS.
   :::

1. Execute [AddDocumentToCaseCommand](.) subflow for each url(document) provided in the input message in parallel. It is important to process these in parallel, 
   so that all documents are always processed despite other documents potentially faulting.

1. End the batch by creating and sending a `documents:endBatch` message to the [document-service](.). This is also automatically done by backend services after approximately 3 hours. Because of this
   the batch should always be ended, even if there are faulting documents. A new batch is started when retrying. Care must be taken though to not accidentally ignore the potential errors from the document uploads.
